# simile — build status

*A quick-reference companion to `DESIGN-diagram.md`, which remains the design record.
Last updated 2026-08-06.*

Ordering follows the implementation plan agreed on 2026-08-01: schema → model layer →
render → §13 ports/segments → creation → deletion → dragging → grammar engine.

**Only the equation parser and file save remain unstarted.**

## Done

**1. Schema — `src/schema/simile-v1.js`**
All four faces of §3 in one file: naming rule, vocabulary (node/arc types with
per-type facts — `has_label`, `autoCreated`, `positionedBy`, `branches`,
`attachmentNode`, `blankEnd`), the grammar rules, the styling defaults, and the
dialog **field model**. Swapping this file is what changes notation.
*Caveat: rules are declared but nothing consults them (see Not started).*

**2. Model layer — `src/diagram.js` (`Sienna.Diagram`)**
A thin wrapper over `userData`: stores no diagram state of its own, so undo and
replay cannot desync it. Every write is one dispatched action = one undo step.
Covers create / add node, submodel, flow, influence, role / setLabel /
setProperties / commitDrag / movePort / moveLabel / setArcBow, plus the derived
indices (`childrenOf`, `descendantsOf`, `arcsAt`, `ancestorsOf`,
`nearestCommonAncestor`, `portsFor`, `allPorts`, `box`).

**3. Rendering — `src/widgets/diagram.js`**
SVG, one flat world coordinate space with a single pan/zoom transform, explicit
layer groups, all layout read through `appearanceOf()`. Glyph shapes and sizes
come from the schema, not from renderer code.

**4. §13 — ports and segments**
Cross-boundary arcs are one arc in the model, drawn as several derived segments.
Ports keyed `(boundary, owner)`: shared on the source side, per-arc on the
target side. Auto-seeded at arc creation, then draggable along their boundary.
Port positions live in `layout/ports/…`, never in the model.

**5. Creation UI**
Palette generated from the schema vocabulary (auto-created types omitted).
Click to place a node; drag out a rectangle for a submodel, which **captures
what it encloses** and re-seeds the ports of arcs that consequently cross.
Arcs drawn source→target, with either end of a flow allowed to be blank canvas.
New elements are born named after their id and open straight into a rename box.

**7. Dragging, re-parenting, and direct manipulation**
Nodes, submodels (carrying contents and boundary ports), labels (stored as an
offset from the notation's default anchor), ports, and influence curvature — all
one undo step per gesture, with nothing written until the drop. Dropping a node
in a submodel re-parents it. Click selects (blue ring), shift/ctrl adds, and a
multiple selection drags together.

**6. Deletion**
Select and press Delete/Backspace. The cascade follows the lifecycle rules of
§4: a submodel takes its contents at any depth; any element takes the arcs
attached to it; a flow takes its valve and vice versa; a **cloud is refcounted**
and goes only when the last flow touching it does. Layout owned by the removed
elements goes too, ports included. One action, so one undo step however wide the
cascade — and the count is reported, since a delete can reach much further than
what was selected. **Deleting a submodel deletes its contents** (ruled
2026-08-04) — dissolving the box while keeping its contents is a separate
**ungroup** command, planned but not built.

**8. Grammar engine — `src/grammar.js`**
Evaluates the schema's rules; contains no rule of its own. All four §12.4
callers exist: `mayConnect` (refuses an illegal arc mid-gesture), `mayContain`
(placing and dropping), `validate` (whole model, reported never blocking, wired
to a **check model** button), and `behaviour` (how to draw — read from the
vocabulary). Rules quantify over derived facts: `parentKind` matches the
inferred *conditional* and *association* kinds as well as the declared one.
The escape hatch is a named predicate in `Sienna.grammar.predicates`; an unknown
name throws rather than silently passing.
*Note: submodel CAPTURE reports rather than refuses — boxing a flat model and
then declaring the box a population passes through an illegal state on purpose.*

**9. Property dialogs — `src/dialog.js`**
Modal, per element type, driven by the schema's field model; an optional HTML
template can replace the generated form, bound by the same `data-field` rule.
OK writes label + props + direct fields in one action; props are merged, not
replaced. Labels are validated, equations are not (stored verbatim).
*Caveat: the property lists themselves are first drafts — to be checked against
Simile type by type.*

**10. View and selection commands — a second row in `src/widgets/diagram.js`**
Plain text buttons, notation-independent (nothing here is read from the schema,
because zooming means the same whatever is drawn): zoom in / out (stepped, about
the panel centre, where the wheel zooms about the pointer), **fit**, **100%**,
**re-centre**, and **select box**.

"100%" is not the identity: the notation's world units are small enough that a
true 1:1 is unreadable, so what it restores is the `defaultScale` option,
**1.8** (set 2026-08-06 by eye) — the first candidate for the Diagram widget's
Settings dialog when there is one. And unlike the stepped buttons it re-centres
as well as re-scales. That was a bug found in testing: hold the panel centre
still and the command faithfully keeps whatever distant spot happens to be
there, so a view that has got away from you — maximise a panel after panning
and the stale transform maps the new centre a long way off — restores to blank
canvas. Restore-default is the command you reach for when lost, so it now always
ends up looking at the model.

Both open questions were settled as the notes predicted. Select box is an
**armed tool**, like a palette entry — that is what keeps it from colliding with
pan, which owns a blank-canvas drag; Escape drops it, and it disarms after one
band, as placing does. And "encloses" is now literally the same test as submodel
capture: `_enclosedBy` was promoted to `Diagram.enclosedBy` and both call it, so
wholly-inside/siblings-only cannot drift apart between the two. Which siblings
is decided by where the drag *started* — begin inside a submodel and you band
its children. Shift/ctrl adds, as for a click.

Two changes fell out of exposing `_fit()` as a command. It now measures the
**SVG** rather than the whole widget (the toolbars above it are not canvas, and
the view transform is measured from the SVG's own origin — with two rows the old
reckoning was visibly off), and it **centres** rather than framing from the
top-left, since `maxFitScale` otherwise strands a small model in the corner.
That also improves the automatic fit on first paint. An explicit fit counts as
the user's view, so a later resize does not silently re-fit over it.

**11. Ungroup — `Diagram.ungroup` + an `edit` group in the palette**
Dissolve a submodel, keep its contents: the opposite intention to deleting it,
which takes them with it, hence a command of its own rather than a modifier on
delete. Only the **immediate children** move — anything deeper stays inside its
own submodel, which is promoted intact — and the promoted contents are left
selected, being what the user still has in hand.

The reuse that made it small: promote the contents *first*, then ask
`deletionClosure` about the box, which by then covers the box and the arcs
attached to it but not its contents. So an arc that cannot survive the box (a
role arc *to* the submodel) goes with the usual valve/cloud consequences,
without any of those rules being restated. The removal writes were factored out
of `remove` into `_purge` so both can share them inside one action — ungroup
promotes, deletes and re-seeds ports in a single dispatch, so a gesture is one
undo step. A breach created by the promotion is reported, never refused, as
submodel capture is (§12.5); the button flashes when nothing is selected.

The palette's first row now ends `… | EDIT ungroup | CHECK check model`, which
keeps the division the two rows already had: row one changes the model, row two
does not.

## Not started

**Equation parser.** A separate utility at widget level. Two things to settle
first: *which parser* (the no-build constraint allows a generator whose output
is vendored, e.g. Peggy, or a hand-written recursive-descent one — the user has
one he likes from webakt, identify that first) and *what it is for*, since the
editor never evaluates equations: syntax checking for the red/black colouring,
and extracting the names an equation references so they can be cross-checked
against the influence arrows actually drawn. A big piece; not started.

**Saving to a file.** Models live in browser `localStorage` only. No export or
import, so a hand-built model does not survive a different browser.

## Known gaps and loose ends

- A flow that crosses a submodel boundary leaves its **valve** where it lies.
- Models built before the valve became derived keep a dead `layout` entry for it.
- **Ghosts** are deliberately out (§15); `appearanceOf()` is the seam for adding
  them later.
- Whether a **role arc** can join submodels at different nesting levels is
  unanswered — nothing depends on it, since flows already prove segments are
  needed.
- When the last arc through a port is deleted, is a dragged port position
  forgotten or remembered? Undecided (§13.4).
- Influence curve geometry is an **arc of a circle** provisionally; quadratic and
  spline remain open (§7.5), and the choice interacts with waypoints if those
  arrive.
- No waypoints on arcs yet — curvature is the only shape control.
- Browser **script caching** bites during development: hard-reload (Ctrl-Shift-R)
  after pulling changes, or the injected widget script may be stale.

## Open questions for the Simile developer

Carried in `DESIGN-diagram.md` §8, still outstanding: the full label-typography
rules and whether name-uniqueness is submodel-scoped; how ghosts are stored (only
if we revive them); the remaining grammar rules; and the exact per-type
completeness (red/black) rule.
